# 20777A: Implementing Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB Solutions

The files for the Allfiles drive are not provided on the course VMs, but are stored in this folder on GitHub. This enables us to more easily update the files as the technology changes. 

You should download the zip for each module from this folder and extract the files to the E:\ folder on the 20777A-LON-DEV VM. 

Important: Many of these zips are multipart and cannot be unzipped easily using the native file compression features of File Explorer. To extract these files, you should use a utility such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, or WinZip.
